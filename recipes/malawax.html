    <p>Malawax (also spelled Malawah) is a sweet, tender, and slightly elastic pancake that is a staple of Somali
        cuisine. Unlike American pancakes, it is typically made as one large, thin pancake that is cooked in a single
        layer in a pan. It has a uniquely soft, chewy texture and is often flavored with cardamom and sometimes sugar.
        It is commonly eaten for breakfast or as a snack, served with tea, honey, butter, or even a dollop of sour
        cream. Its delightful flavor and simple ingredients have made it popular across the Horn of Africa and beyond.
